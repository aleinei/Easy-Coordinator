# Easy-Coordinator

This application should include all the orders or any of their items that are not delivered to the client or captain or pilot
the first screen should show a list of such orders
when cliking on an order, its items should show with color code indicating the unfinished items, the finished and not yet delivered items
the unfinished items can not be clicked
only the finished items can be clicked
when an item is clicked that means it is delivered to the concerned person and it disappears for the list
if the last finished item is clicked the order disappears and the next order is displayed
the finished order shoud be directed to the concerned person, i.e. the captain, the pilot, or the customer
the finished order should show on the pilot's application that it is ready for delivery
or should be shown on the captain's application indicating it is ready to be put on the customer's table
