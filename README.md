# Easy-Coordinator

1-  This application should include all the orders or any of their items that are not delivered to the client or captain or pilot

2-  the first screen should show a list of such orders

3-  when cliking on an order, its items should show with color code indicating the unfinished items, the finished and not yet delivered items

4-  the unfinished items can not be clicked

5-  only the finished items can be clicked

6-  when an item is clicked that means it is delivered to the [COORDINATOR] application and should appear on that application, and it then disappears from the list

7-  if the last finished item is clicked the order disappears and and will appear on the [COORDINATOR]'s application, the next order is then displayed
